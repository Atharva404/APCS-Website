            <p>As we started this project, we wanted to take this time and thank you for giving us a boost in our learning to becoming great individuals in the future!
                The project started off with Charan and Atharva working on creating a website and since this is the last week of school, 
                we wanted to collectively take some friends we knew and write some quotes on the website as well as say a few words on the youtube video.
