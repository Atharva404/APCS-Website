        <p><em>"Thank You Mr. Morgan for an Awesome Year! It has been an amazing learning experience and I hope we can continute extended our learning abilities and learn new areas of computer science all the way till the end
             of Advanced Computer Science! As I started 10th grade, I came in knowing only how to start a class and not even any experience within a for loop, but with your guidance, my knowledge has grown exponentially with 
             new knowledge in the area of arrays, arraylists, objects, classes, etc. Thank you for this learning experience!"<strong>- Atharva Gupta</strong></em></p>

            <p>As we started this project, we wanted to take this time and thank you for giving us a boost in our learning to becoming great individuals in the future!
                The project started off with Charan and Atharva working on creating a website and since this is the last week of school, 
                we wanted to collectively take some friends we knew and write some quotes on the website.
